OpenCachingFun
==============
This is an Android app that helps in geocaching. It is using opencaching.pl site.

It used to use ActionBarSherlock, but now I want to integrate it with HoloEverywhere. I've tried to remove all connections to ABS, but it seems that I'm unable to do so. That's why this projects will compile but will not be fully operational (something wrong with Fragments). When the migration to HoloEverywhere is complete- app should work again ;).
