OpenCachingFun
==============
This is an Android app that helps in geocaching. It is using opencaching.pl site.

How to run/open in IDE
======================
If you haven't been using maven for android projects before (or maven at all):
* make sure you have maven installed (so you can invoke mvn from console)
* make sure all google/android-related libs are available in your local maven repository (use this nice [project](https://github.com/mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployer#readme) to do so)

Now all you have to do is import project to your favorite IDE. I'm using intelliJ IDEA (and I recommend you to use it too at least for all your Android work) and there you just have to click _File_ -> _Import project_ and point it to the 'pom.xml' file in this repo.

If you are using Eclipse, it shouldn't be much different, look for something like 'import' and then 'existing maven project'.

And there, you are all set! If you wish to build and use this app, you will have to fill OKAPI and GoogleMaps api keys.
